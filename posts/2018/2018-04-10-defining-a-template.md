# Defining a Template

Now that I got the first blog post out of the way, it's time to come up with a template for this blog. Not the structure of the actual site or anything, just a format for the blog content itself. Like what the posts are gonna be about and stuff. For now, I think I'll just have it be a stream of consciousness style writing as I go through each step in making my blog.

So before going any further, I should probably define the Minimum Viable Product. So the MVP is just being able to read these posts online.

First thing is I'll need to turn these Markdown files into HTML. I want my posts to be in Markdown because it's pretty easy to compose technical blog posts in this language. I'll just use a GitLab repository as my Content Management System. If you don't know GitLab is, it's like GitHub but better because it has a little fox logo which shimmers as you move your cursor over it.

Then I'll need the blog boilerplate templates for navigation.

And...

Some CSS I guess?

And then put it on the internet.
