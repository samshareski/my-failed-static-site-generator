# The Cart Before the Horse

The prospect of making my own blog has always been intimidating to me. When it comes to side projects in general, I prefer to focus on unimportant aspects, like configuring 100 Vim plugins, until I get frustrated and give up. To avoid this fate once again, I'm going to try another way. As I type this post, I have just a single Markdown file in an otherwise empty project. Once I pen this first entry, I'll be free to waste time on all the insignificant details that have nothing to do with actually getting these words onto your screen. But if you're reading this, then I'll have succeeded anyway.
